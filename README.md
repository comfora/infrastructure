# Infrastructure

Open-sourced internal repository of services and documentation primarily for Comfora while providing a knowledge garden for all.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Comfora is dedicated to having **complete transparency** within the organization, which is why we're **open-sourcing** our `comfora/infrastructure` repository for community guidance and library of resources.
>
> However, some documentation and or aspects  will remain internal or remain abstracted as to allow some security to be had within our organization.
